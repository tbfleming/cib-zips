A cleaned-up Stanford Bunny, with the holes in the model sealed.

This piece has a nice, rounded base, which makes it ideal for scaling up and
printing even on machines without a heated build platform or chamber. The
ears are just within the limits of overhang that a makerbot can handle, so
depending on your temperature settings you may get some sagging on the lower
edges of the ears.
